# AIM - 
To Print "Hello World" and program a simple calculator in C++

## Theory

C++ is a general-purpose, high-performance programming language that builds on the foundation of the C language. Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s at Bell Labs, C++ is a cross-platform language used to create high-performance applications. It supports object-oriented programming, making it a versatile tool for various types of software development.

This experiment consists of two practicals namely printing of `"Hello World"` and making of calculator program.
### Experiment 1a: Hello, World! - 
In the hello world program , the `cout` function from the iostream library is commonly used to print output to the console. The iostream library in C++ is a part of the Standard Library and provides functionalities for input and output operations.The `using namespace std;` directive is used to avoid the need to prefix standard library names with `std::`.

### Experiment 1b: Calculator - 
Basic airthmetic operations`(+,-,/,*)` were used to create the calculator program. While `cin` function is used to recive inputs from the user.
