## Theory

C++ is a general-purpose, high-performance programming language that builds on the foundation of the C language. Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s at Bell Labs, C++ is a cross-platform language used to create high-performance applications. It supports object-oriented programming, making it a versatile tool for various types of software development.

In C++, the `cout` function from the iostream library is commonly used to print output to the console.
